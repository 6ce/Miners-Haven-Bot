# Miners Haven Bot
python script that utilizes Tesseract to extract text from roblox to automate rebirthing and placing layouts

# Features
- Automatically rebirths when you have enough money (does not account for life skipping)
- Automatically will place layouts (based on configuration during setup)

# Disclaimer
 - It's buggy. (and only tested on Windows, it has to be changed in order to run on any other OS's probably)
 - No other anti-afk software is required

# Setup
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Install [Tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
- Go into your installation directory, and run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Configure `haven.py` as it tells you to
- Once you load into Miner's Haven, enable "Scientific Notation" in the game settings
- Make sure your game is in fullscreen mode
- Once configured and ingame, run `python main.py`

# Usage
- Hold CTRL + Q to stop the script from running
- While running, make sure nothing covers up your game
